Challenge 1
<!-- Predicted Output: Blank Spaces but follows a pattern -->
Output:
	*
	**
	***

Explanation for wrong prediction: In line 5, I forgot that result was incremented with j, I thought it was only incremented with whitespace.



Challenge 2
<!-- Predicted Output: 
	[40, 20, 30, 10]
	[40, 20, 30, 10]
 -->
Output: 
	[40, 20, 30, 10]
	[40, 20, 30, 10]



Challenge 3
<!-- Predicted Output: [85, 90] -->
Output: [60, 45, 85, 90]

Explanation for wrong prediction: I did not analyze the code enough and thought the the function was supposed to filter the parameter but it actually only arranged it.

	[
		{id: 1, completed: true},
		{id: 2, completed: false}
	]
	[
		{id: 1, completed: true},
		{id: 2, completed: false}
	]
 -->
 Output: 
	[
		{id: 1, completed: true},
		{id: 2, completed: false}
	]
	[
		{id: 1, completed: true},
		{id: 2, completed: false}
	]
