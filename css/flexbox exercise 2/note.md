This task took me 20 minutes to accomplish. Just like the previous flexbox exercise, there was a provided code which made the task less time consuming. I solved the problem by looking side by side with the reference image and my work. The exact measurements were not provided so I had to eyeball it to be as accurate as possible. The main difficulty I faced in this task was wether to strictly follow the instructions. For instance, one instruction stated "Use justify-content and align-items to align and space the elements." but I felt like it was unnecessary since I did not need it.
